# Nellis Auction Bid Calculator

## Problem: 

Sometimes it's difficult to gauge/estimate what your final price will be on a Nellis auction bid. 

You're a Nellisauction.com customer browsing through the auctions. You see an item you want. Let's say it's a laptop. You see the laptop retails for $800. The current bid is at 450. You place a bid at $500, since that's still 300 dollars below retail price. Somebody outbids you for $550. You bid $560, they bid $570. 

Should you bid $580? 

That's still $220 below retail... right? 

# Actually...

The final price with tax, and the nellis auction 10% fee is $721.89. You'd still be saving $80 off the retail price, but maybe it'd be better to just bid another day. (Sorry spencer)

## Solution:

With the nellis auction bid calculator you can accurately gauge how much you should be bidding with a few easy steps. 
Just input your bid price and the calculator will do the math for you and spit out the accurate final price (based on 2023 state sales taxes) .
